    <h2>Hot Lunch Information</h2>
    <p> Please make sure that you include your hot lunch slip with your payment.
        If you are unable to print out the slip, please hand write one with your child's first and last name, grade and amount of order.
    </p>

    <p> Do not submit hand written changes to your order after it has been submitted online.
        What is submitted online is the final order.  We will do our best to accommodate changes, but make no promises.
    </p>
    <p>
        Payment needs to be made in full when the orders are processed and mailed to the attention of John Sarni through school mail.
        If payment is not received prior the following month's hot lunch orders, you will not be able to receive hot lunch for the following month.
    </p>
